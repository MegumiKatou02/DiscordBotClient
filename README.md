# Discord Bot Client

*This is my first time writing code to build a Discord bot, so I have no experience* :3
   
## About
This bot contains many features that make life easier, help manage tasks, and provide entertainment:
- A reminder system
- Task automation
- Weather updates
- Fun commands (jokes, trivia, etc.)
- Event scheduling
## Usage
- Invite the bot.
- Type `/help` to see a list of all available commands; Use `/send_dev` to send a message about issues with the bot to the developer

## Thank to

- [Discloud](https://discloud.com/) for providing 24/7 support and hosting services for my Discord bot
